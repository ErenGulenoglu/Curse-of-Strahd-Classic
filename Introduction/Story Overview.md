Adventurers from a foreign land find themselves in Barovia, a mysterious realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by [[Strahd von Zarovich]], a vampire and wizard. Using a [[Tarokka Cards|deck of tarokka cards]] to predict their future, a fortune-teller named [[Madam Eva]] sets them on a dark course that takes them to many corners of [[Barovia]], culminating with a vampire hunt in [[Castle Ravenloft]].

Madam Eva's people are called the [[Vistani]]. They travel in covered wagons from world to world, luring strangers into Strahd's domain.

Barovia is a land of ghosts, werewolves, and other fell creatures. The wilderness hides many secrets, including forgotten ruins and battlefields that tell the story of Strahd's life as a conqueror. Adventurers who explore the wilderness find the remnants of Strahd's ancient enemies—some of whom are not as dead as one might expect.

For the people of Barovia, there is no escape from this harsh land. [[The Town of Vallaki|The town of Vallaki]] stands ready to defend itself against the servants of Strahd, but it's far from the sanctuary it claims to be. [[The Village of Krezk|The village of Krezk]] lies near the edge of Strahd's domain, its abbey now in the clutches of evil, misguided creatures.

Of all the settlements in Strahd's domain, [[The Village of Barovia|the village of Barovia]] is by far the most oppressed. Many of its shops are closed, and the locals have succumbed to despair. It is well known that Strahd desires the burgomaster’s adopted daughter, [[Ireena Kolyana]]. The villagers neither protect nor harm her, lest they incur the vampire’s wrath. Few know that Ireena bears an uncanny resemblance to Tatyana, Strahd’s dead beloved.

The village of Barovia cowers in the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, Strahd's home and fortress. The castle stands atop a great spire of rock—invincible and ever watchful. Every night, thousands of bats fly out of the castle to feed. It is said that Strahd sometimes flies with them. Barovia will never be safe until the evil in his castle is destroyed.

Once Strahd becomes aware of the adventurers, he and his spies watch them closely. When the time is right, Strahd invites his "guests" to Castle Ravenloft. He aims to turn them against one another, torment them, and kill them, as he has done with so many other visitors. Some will become undead thralls. Others will never rise again.

The adventurers’ best hope of defeating Strahd is to learn his secrets, for he is no ordinary vampire. Guided by Madam Eva’s card reading, they must scour his domain and his castle for magic items that might weaken or slay him—all while trying to stay alive.

Although the adventurers can escape by slaying Strahd, he can’t be truly destroyed. Barovia is his prison, and not even death can free him from his curse. The adventure ends when either Strahd von Zarovich or the characters are defeated. Your goal is to keep Strahd in play for as long as possible, using all the abilities and resources at his disposal.
