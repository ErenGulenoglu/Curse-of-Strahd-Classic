Much of the adventure’s action is driven by the clash between the adventurers’ decisions and [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s goals. Both the adventurers and the vampire are caught in strands of fate, represented by a special card reading detailed in **Chapter 1: “Into the Mists.”** Before you run the adventure, you’ll need to conduct this reading to determine the location of several key story items, as well as one of the possible locations where Strahd can be found.

Chapter 1 also outlines Strahd’s goals and suggests adventure hooks to draw the player characters into the cursed realm of Barovia. If the characters are 1st level, the character backgrounds in **Appendix A** are available to them. You might also consider beginning their journey with the mini-adventure **“Death House”** in **Appendix B**.

**Chapter 2: “The Lands of Barovia”** provides an overview of the realm and includes special rules for it and its people—including the mysterious [[Vistani]]. **Chapters 3–15** detail locations corresponding to areas on the [[Barovia]] map introduced in Chapter 2.

The **epilogue** presents ways to conclude the adventure.
- **Appendix C** details the special items—magical or otherwise—introduced in the story.
- **Appendix D** provides stat blocks for Strahd and various NPCs and monsters that may be encountered in Barovia.
- **Appendix E** shows the **[[Fortunes of Ravenloft|tarokka cards]]** the Vistani use for fortune-telling.
- **Appendix F** contains **player handouts** to help immerse your players in the story.
