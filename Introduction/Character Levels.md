The adventure is meant for characters of levels 1–10 and includes threats for those levels and beyond. [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] can be an especially deadly challenge at these levels. It is assumed that the characters will gain levels over the course of the adventure, as well as acquire allies and powerful magic items that can tip the scales in their favor. Characters who head directly to [[Castle Ravenloft]] without first increasing their power will likely die.

You can award experience points for the defeat of foes, use milestone awards, or a mixture of both. Given the fact that much of the adventure involves social interaction and exploration, rather than combat, your work will probably be easier if you use milestone awards. Appropriate milestone awards include the following:
- **Finding artifacts.** The characters gain a level when they obtain the *[[Tome of Strahd]]*, the *[[Sunsword]]*, or the *[[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]]*. 
- **Defeating villains.** The characters gain a level when they defeat the featured antagonist(s) in a location, such as the hags in [[Old Bonegrinder]] (chapter 6). 
- **Accomplishing story goals.** The characters gain a level when they accomplish something significant, such as lighting the beacon of [[Argynvostholt]] (chapter 7), thwarting the druids' ritual atop [[Yester Hill]] (chapter 14), or forging an alliance with [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir]] (appendix D). Appendix B, "[[Death House]]," uses milestone awards by way of example.

Be prepared for the fact that the adventure is exceedingly open-ended—one of the hallmarks of the original [[Ravenloft]]. The card reading in chapter 1 and the adventurers' choices can lead them all over the map, and a party can easily wander into an area well beyond their power. If you'd like to steer them toward places that correspond to their level, consult the Areas by Level table, but beware of undermining the sense that the characters' choices matter. Sometimes the adventurers will simply need to flee or hide when they are out of their depth.

If an area of the adventure ends up feeling free of mystery or danger, consider using tips from the "[[Marks of Horror]]" section to increase the ominousness. If a combat encounter feels too easy, either (a) guide it to its end as quickly as possible or (b) increase the threat by raising a foe's hit point maximum to the upper end of its hit point range, by adding monsters/traps, or both.
