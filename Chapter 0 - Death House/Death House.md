You can run _Curse of Strahd_ for 1st-level characters with the help of this optional mini-adventure, which is designed to advance characters to 3rd level. Players creating 1st-level characters can use the haunted one character background in appendix A, or they can pick backgrounds from the _Player's Handbook_ as normal.

Before the characters can explore the haunted town house known as Death House, you need to guide them to [[The Village of Barovia|the village of Barovia]]. The "[[Creeping Fog]]" adventure hook in chapter 1 works best, as it introduces few distractions. Once the characters arrive in Strahd's domain, steer them to the village. For the duration of this introductory adventure, any attempt by the characters to explore other locations in Strahd's domain causes the mists of [[Ravenloft]] to block their path.

**Level Advancement**
In this mini-adventure, the characters gain levels by accomplishing specific goals, rather than by slaying monsters. These milestones are as follows:
- Characters who gain access to the secret stairs in the attic (area 21) advance to 2nd level. The stairs appear only under certain circumstances.
- Characters advance to 3rd level once they escape from the house (see the "Endings" section).
