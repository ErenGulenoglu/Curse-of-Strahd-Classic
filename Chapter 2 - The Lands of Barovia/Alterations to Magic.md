The land of [[Barovia]] resides in its own demiplane, isolated from all other planes, including the Material Plane. No spell-not even _wish_-allows one to escape from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s domain. _Astral projection_, _teleport_, _plane shift_, and similar spells cast for the purpose of leaving Barovia simply fail, as do effects that banish a creature to another plane of existence. These restrictions apply
to magic items and artifacts that have properties that transport or banish creatures to other planes. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, such as the _etherealness_ spell and the Etherealness feature of incorporeal undead, is the exception to this rule. A creature that enters the Border Ethereal from Strahd's domain is pulled back into Barovia upon leaving that plane.

For the purpose of spells whose effects change across or are blocked by planar boundaries (such as _sending_), Strahd's domain is considered its own plane. Magic that summons creatures or objects from other planes functions normally in Barovia, as does magic that involves an extradimensional space. Any spells cast within such an extradimensional space (such as that created by
_Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion_) are subject to the same restrictions as magic cast in Barovia.

While in Barovia, characters who receive spells from deities or otherworldly patrons continue to do so. In addition, spells that allow contact with beings from other planes function normally—with one proviso: Strahd can sense when someone in his domain is casting such a spell and can choose to make himself the spell's recipient, so that he becomes the one who is contacted.

## Cosmetic Spell Modifications
At your discretion, a spell can be modified cosmetically to enhance the horrific atmosphere. Here are examples:

**_Alarm_**: Instead of hearing a mental ping when the alarm is triggered, the caster hears a scream.
_**Bigby's hand**_: The conjured hand is skeletal.
**_Find familiar_**: The familiar is undead—not a celestial, fey, or fiend—and is immune to features that turn undead.
**_Find steed_**: The summoned steed is undead—not a celestial, fey, or fiend—and is immune to features that turn undead.
**_Find the path_**: A child's spirit appears and guides the caster to the desired location. The spirit can't be harmed and doesn't speak.
**_Fog cloud_**: Misty, harmless claws form in the fog.
**_Gust of wind_**: A ghastly moan accompanies the summoned wind.
**_Mage hand_**: The summoned hand is skeletal.
**_Maze_**: The surfaces of the demi plane's maze are made of mortared skulls and bones.
**_Phantom steed_**: The steed resembles a skeletal horse.
**_Rary's telepathic bond_**: Characters linked together by the spell can't shake the feeling that something vile is telepathically eavesdropping on them.
**_Revivify_**: A creature restored to life by a _revivify_ spell screams upon regaining consciousness, as though waking from some horrible nightmare.
**_Spirit guardians_**: The spirits appear as ghostly, skeletal warriors.
**_Wall of stone_**: A wall created by the spell has ghastly faces sculpted into it, as though tortured spirits were somehow trapped within the stone.

## Resurrection Madness
In Barovia, the souls of the dead are as trapped as the souls of the living. They become caught in the mists and can't travel to the afterlife.

When a humanoid who has been dead for at least 24 hours returns to life, either by way of a spell or some supernatural means, it gains a random form of indefinite madness brought on by the realization that its spirit is trapped in Barovia, likely forever. To determine how this madness is expressed, roll on the Indefinite Madness table in chapter 8 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_.
