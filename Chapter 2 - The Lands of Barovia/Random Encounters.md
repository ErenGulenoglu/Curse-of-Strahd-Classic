Dangers abound in the land of [[Barovia]]. Check for a random encounter after every 30 minutes that the adventurers spend on the roads or in the wilderness (don't check if they have already had two random encounters outdoors in the past 12 hours):
- If the characters are on a road, an encounter occurs on a roll of 18 or higher on a d20.
- If the characters are in the wilderness, an encounter occurs on a roll of 15 or higher on a d20.
If an encounter occurs, roll on the daytime or the nighttime encounter table, depending on the time, or have [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s spies appear (see the "Strahd's Spies" sidebar).

Use the descriptions that follow to help run each random encounter. The table entries are presented in alphabetical order.

**Barovian Commoners**

	The sound of snapping twigs draws your attention to several dark shapes in the fog. They carry torches and pitchforks.

If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from these [[Barovians]], who carry pitchforks (+2 to hit) instead of clubs, dealing 3 (1d6) piercing damage on a hit.

Barovian commoners rarely leave their settlements. This group might be a family looking for a safer place to live, or an angry mob searching for the characters or heading toward [[Castle Ravenloft]] to confront Strahd.

**Barovian Scouts**
If at least one character has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher, read:

	You see a dark figure crouched low and perfectly still, aiming a crossbow in your direction.

If more than one scout is present, the others are spread out over a 100-foot-square area.

These scouts are Barovian hunters or trappers searching for a missing villager or townsperson. Once they realize the characters aren't out to kill them, they lower their weapons and request help in finding their missing person. If the characters decline, the scouts point them in the direction of the nearest settlement and depart without so much as a farewell. They wield light crossbows (+4 to hit, range 80/320 ft.) instead of longbows, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage on a hit.

**Berserkers**
These wild mountain folk are covered head to toe in thick gray mud, which makes them hard to see in the fog and well hidden in the mountains they call home. While so camouflaged, they have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. Characters whose passive Wisdom (Perception) scores are higher than the berserker's Dexterity (Stealth) check can spot the nearest berserker.

If someone spots the berserker, read:

	You startle a wild-looking figure caked in gray mud and clutching a crude stone axe. Whether it's a man or a woman, you can't tell.

The berserkers shun civilized folk. They try to remain hidden and withdraw if they are spotted, attacking only if trapped or threatened.

**Corpse**
This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no counter.

	You find a corpse.
Roll a d6 to determine the nature of the corpse: 
**1-2.** The corpse belonged to a wolf killed by spears and crossbow bolts. 
**3-5.** The corpse belongs to a Barovian man, woman, or child who was clearly torn to pieces by dire wolves. If the party is accompanied by Barovian scouts (see above), the scouts recognize the corpse as the person they were searching for.
**6.** The corpse looks like one of the characters (deter mined randomly) but has been stripped of armor, weapons, and valuables. If moved, its flesh melts away until only the skeleton remains.

**Dire Wolves**

	A snarling wolf the size of a grizzly bear steps out of the fog.
The area is lightly obscured by fog. If more than one dire wolf is present, the others aren't far behind and can be seen as dark shadows in the fog. The dire wolves of Barovia are cruel, overgrown wolves and Strahd's loyal servants. They can't be charmed or frightened.

**Druid and Twig Blights**

	A gaunt figure with wild hair and bare feet bounds toward you on all fours, wearing a tattered gown of stitched ani mal skins. You can't tell whether it's a man or a woman. It stops, sniffs the air, and laughs like a lunatic. The ground nearby is crawling with tiny twig monsters.
The Barovian wilderness is home to druids who worship Strahd because of his ability to control the weather and the beasts of Barovia. The druids are savage and violent, and each controls a host of twig blights, which fights until destroyed. If all the twig blights are destroyed or the druid loses more than half of its hit points, the druid flees, heading toward [[Yester Hill]] (area Y).

**False Trail**

	You discover a foot trail that cuts through the wilderness.
Evil druids left this trail. Following it in either direction leads to a spiked pit (see "Sample Traps" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). A thin tarp made of twigs and pine needles conceals the pit, the bottom of which is lined with sharpened wooden stakes.

**Ghost**

	A baleful apparition appears before you, its hollow eyes dark with anger.
Many ghosts haunt this land. This particular ghost is Iall that remains of a person drained of life by Strahd (decide whether it's a man or a woman). It appears and hisses, "No one will ever know you died here." It then at tacks. If the ghost succeeds in possessing a character, it leads its host to the gates of [[Ravenloft]] (area J) and hurls the host's body into the chasm.

**Grave**
This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.

	You stumble upon an old grave.
There is a 25 percent chance that the grave is intact, appearing as an elongated earthen mound or a rocky cairn. Characters who dig up the grave find the skeletal remains of a human clad in rusted chain mail (a soldier). Among the bones lie corroded weapons. If the grave isn't intact, it has been violated. The char acters find a shallow, mud-filled hole with dirt or rocks strewn around it and a few scattered bones within.

**Hidden Bundle**
This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter. 
The characters find a leather-wrapped bundle hidden in the underbrush, stuffed inside a hollow log, or nestled in the boughs of a tree. If they open the. bundle; read:

	The bundle contains one set.of common clothes sized for a human adult.
The clothes have a drab Barovian style to them. They belong to a wereraven or werewolf.

**Hunting Trap**
This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise., treat the result as no encounter.

Have each of the characters in the front rank of the party's marching order make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. If one or more of them succeeds, read:

	You spot a wolf trap, its steel jaws caked with rust. Some one has carefully hidden the trap under a thin layer of pine needles and detritus.
Barovian hunters and trappers set these traps hoping to thin out the wolf population, but Strahd's wolves are too clever to be caught in them. If none of the characters in the front rank spots the hidden trap, one random party member steps on it. Rules for the hunting trap are presented in chapter 5, "Equipment," of the _Player's Handbook_.
