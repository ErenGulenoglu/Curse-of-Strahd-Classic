In the event that begins the adventure, the fates of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and the adventurers are entwined as the characters are invited or forced into his domain. Different ways to get the adventurers to [[Barovia]] are described in the sections that follow. Use whichever one you favor.

In "[[Plea for Help]]," a colorfully dressed stranger approaches the characters while they are staying at a tavern. The stranger delivers a letter from his master, inviting them to the village of Barovia with an urgent request for their assistance. If the characters take the bait, the fog engulfs them as they cross into Strahd's domain.

In "[[Mysterious Visitors]]," the characters are asked to scare off a band of rowdy travelers who are camped outside the town of [[Daggerford]], on the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. The travelers welcome the characters to their camp and invite them to sit by their fire while their elder recounts a tragic tale of a cursed yet noble prince. The characters, lulled into a
trance by the fire, awaken to find themselves on a foggy road, delivered to Barovia by their [[Vistani]] hosts.

In "[[Werewolves in the Mist]]," the characters are drawn together by a series of werewolf attacks. The hunt for this pack of lycanthropes leads the characters into a forest, where they are swept into the land of Barovia. This hook assumes the use of the five factions featured in the Adventurers League.

In "[[Creeping Fog]]," the characters are traveling a lonely road through the woods when the fog engulfs them, spiriting them away to the land of Barovia.
