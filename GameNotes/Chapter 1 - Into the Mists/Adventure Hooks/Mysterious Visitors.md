The details of this adventure hook assume that your D&D campaign is based in or near [[Daggerford]], a town on the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms, but you can change the location to suit your campaign.

	Duchess Morwen of Daggerford is having guests for dinner-and you are invited. No strangers to Daggerford, you have come to the town's defense on more than one occasion, and you count Lady Morwen as a friend and a benefactor.
	A cool autumn breeze blows through the streets as you make your way to the keep. As you dine on hot, spicy soup and tenderly cooked pheasant, you can tell that the duchess seems more out of sorts than usual. Then a pall comes over the occasion as she voices her concern about a band of wayward travelers camped outside the town's walls. They seemed harmless at first, but Morwen has received reports that they have begun harassing townsfolk and other visitors as they come and go, demanding money and wine, and threatening to put hexes on anyone who doesn't pay up.
	Yesterday, the duchess ordered several guards to scare away the mysterious visitors, but they couldn't get the job done. When the guards returned, they spoke sympathetically about the visitors. It seemed as if the guards had been magically charmed.
	Morwen doesn't want an armed conflict, but she aims to send a stern message to the visitors and asks you to deliver it on her behalf. "If they don't leave before dawn," she says, "I'll burn their wagons to the ground."

The characters are asked to deliver [[Duchess Morwen]]'s message immediately after dinner.

The travelers are camped on the hill outside the gates of Daggerford, near the road. Guards atop the walls watch the camp closely at all hours.

When the characters approach the camp, read:

	As the evening grows dark, you see a dozen men and women gathered around a crackling bonfire. The folk are in good spirits. A few of them sing and dance around the fire while others find happiness in their flasks and wineskins. Three barrel-topped wagons are parked at odd angles. Tied to a nearby tree, grazing, are half a dozen draft horses wearing bright coats with bangles and tassels.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The men and women are [[Vistani]]. They have no interest in Daggerford. Their orders are to deliver the characters safely to [[Barovia]].</mark>

The leader of this group is [[Stanimir]] (CN male human), an old man with the statistics of a **mage** who has the following spells prepared:

	Cantrips (at will): friends, light, mage hand, prestidigitation
	1st level (4 slots): charm person, mage armor, shield, sleep
	2nd level (3 slots): misty step, suggestion
	3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, phantom steed, vampiric touch
	4th level (3 slots): greater invisibility, stoneskin
	5th level (1 slot): dominate person
Stanimir is joined by his daughter, [[Damia]] (CN male human **spy**), and his son, [[Ratka]] (CN male human **bandit captain**). Nine other Vistani (CN male and female **bandits**) heed Ratka's commands. The six draft horses are used to pull the Vistani wagons, which contain their belongings but nothing of value.

## The Dancing Fire
Stanimir introduces himself and welcomes the characters to his camp. If they deliver Duchess Morwen's warning, read:

	Stanimir laughs. "Don't worry. We have no wish to make enemies of Lady Morwen. I have a story to tell all of you. First you listen, then we go."
If the characters agree to hear Stanimir's story, he invites them to gather around the fire and hear his tale:

	Stanimir fills his mouth with wine, then spits into the fire. The flames turn from orange to green. As they dance and sway, a dark shape appears in the bonfire's core.
	"We come from an ancient land whose name is long forgotten-a land of kings. Our enemies forced us from our homes, and now we wander the lost roads."
	The dark shape in the fire takes the form of a man being knocked from his horse, a spear piercing his side.
	Stanimir continues. "One night, a wounded soldier staggered into our camp and collapsed. We nursed his terrible injury and quenched his thirst with wine. He survived. When we asked him who he was, he wouldn't say. All he wanted was to return home, but we were deep in the land of his enemies. We took him as one of our own and followed him back toward his homeland. His enemies hunted him. They said he was a prince, yet we didn't give him up, even when their assassins fell upon us like wolves."
	Deep in the bonfire, you see the dark figure standing with sword drawn, fighting off a host of shadowy shapes.
	"This man of royal blood fought to protect us, as we protected him. We bore him safely to his home, and he thanked us. He said, 'I owe you my life. Stay as long as you wish, leave when you choose, and know that you will always be safe here."'
	The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.
	Stanimir's face becomes a somber mask. "A curse has befallen our noble prince, turning him into a tyrant. We alone have the power to leave his domain. We've traveled far and wide to find heroes such as yourselves to end our dread lord's curse and put his troubled soul to rest. Our leader, Madam Eva, knows all. Will you return to Barovia with us and speak with her?"	
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">These Vistani refuse to speak the name of their "dread lord" and provide no additional information. If the characters press them for details, the Vistani reply, "Madam Eva has the answers you seek."</mark>

If the characters agree to accompany the Vistani, the Vistani lead them south along the Trade Way. After several days of uneventful travel, the mists of Ravenloft engulf the caravan, transporting the characters and the Vistani to Barovia. The Vistani then lead the party safely to their leader, [[Madam Eva]], at area G (see chapter 2). The characters arrive at area A and are taken through areas B, E, and F on the way to Madam Eva's camp. If the characters rid themselves of their Vistani hosts before reaching Madam Eva's camp, they're on the own.

If the characters decline Stanimir's invitation, the Vistani are disappointed but leave as promised. A day or two later, use the "[[Creeping Fog]]" adventure hook or some variation of it to draw the characters into Barovia.
