This scenario assumes that the characters are camping in a forest when the fog engulfs them. They are quietly borne to the edge of [[Barovia]].

	The woods are quiet this night, and the air grows chill. Your fire sputters as a low mist gathers around the edges of your camp, growing closer as the night wears on. By morning, the fog hangs thick in the air, turning the trees around you into gray ghosts. Then you notice these aren't the same trees that surrounded you the night before.
	
No matter which direction they go, the characters come. to a lonely dirt road that cuts through the woods, leading to area A (see chapter 2). <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">As an alternative, you can have them. enter Barovia near [[The Village of Krezk|Krezk]] (see chapter 8).</mark>
