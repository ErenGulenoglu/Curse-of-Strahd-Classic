This adventure hook assumes you're running a campaign in or near [[Daggerford]] (see "Mysterious Visitors" for more information). It also assumes you're using the five player factions featured in the Adventurers League.

	"Werewolves in the mist!" You've heard these dreaded words spoken again and again by farmers, merchants, and adventurers alike. The hamlets east of Daggerford have fallen prey to a pack of werewolves that spills out of the Misty Forest on nights of the full moon, cloaked in crawling mist that seems to follow them wherever they go. The beasts spread death and mayhem, slaughtering adults and stealing children before retreating back into the woods. Others have tried to combat the werewolf menace, with little success.

The [[Misty Forest]] lies thirty miles east of Daggerford. Before the characters embark on their quest, those who have faction allegiances receive additional information described in the sections that follow. Take the players aside, and read them the boxed text for their faction.

## Harpers

	A Harper named Zelraun Roaringhorn knows a metalsmith who will silver your weapons for free. He also provides some helpful magic.
	"We strive to protect the powerless," he says. "If the children kidnapped by the werewolves are still alive, I would see them safely returned."

[[Zelraun Roaringhorn]] (LN male human **mage**) has come to Daggerford to meet with its ruler, [[Duchess Morwen]], and offer the Harpers' support.

Zelraun gives each Harper character <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a spell scroll of remove curse</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">He has also made arrangements with a metalsmith in Waterdeep to sheathe the characters' weapons in silver.</mark> The party can have up to six weapons silvered in this manner. Twenty pieces of ammunition count as one weapon for this purpose.

**About the Harpers.** The Harpers is a network of spellcasters and spies who advocate equality and who covertly oppose the abuse of power. The organization's longevity is largely due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the autonomy of its members. The Harpers have small cells and lone operatives throughout the Forgotten Realms. They share information with
one another from time to time as needs warrant. The Harpers' ideology is noble, and its members pride themselves on their ingenuity and incorruptibility.

## Order of The Gauntlet

	You met with the heads of the Order of the Gauntlet chapter house in Waterdeep. They've stationed members of the order at various inns and homesteads east of Daggerford, so that locals need not fear the night. Now they're counting on you to find the werewolves' lair in the Misty Forest. Only then can the order mount an organized assault. As you prepare to depart, a knight of the order named Lanniver Strayl offers you his blessing.

[[Lanniver Strayl]] (LG male human **knight**), a devout follower of Tyr recently arrived in Daggerford, gives a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">potion of heroism to each member of the order in the party.</mark>

**About the Order of the Gauntlet.** Founded by paladins and clerics of Helm, Torm, and Tyr, the order is a dedicated group of like-minded individuals driven by religious zeal or a finely honed sense of justice and honor. The order is ready to lash out the moment evil acts, and not a moment before. The order strikes hard and fast, without waiting for the blessings of temples or the permission of rulers. The order believes that evil must be smashed, or it will swiftly overcome all.

## Emerald Enclave

	You don't need to consult with others in the Emerald Enclave to know that the werewolves are upsetting the natural order. For balance to be restored, they must be eradicated. It seems the gods of nature agree, for they've sent good weather and preserved the monsters' tracks.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Members of the Emerald Enclave in the party gain inspiration whenever the party kills a werewolf.</mark>

**About the Emerald Enclave.** This widespread group of wilderness survivalists-preserves the natural order while rooting out unnatural threats. Druids, rangers, and barbarians make up most of its membership.
Branches of the organization can be found wherever untamed wilderness exists. Members of the Emerald Enclave know how to survive, and more important, they want to help others do the same. They aren't opposed to civilization or progress, but they strive to prevent civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another.

## Lords' Alliance

	A Lords' Alliance operative from Waterdeep named Eravien Haund comes to Daggerford bearing news that alliance agents have not only captured one of the werewolves but also conducted a thorough interrogation before putting the creature out of its misery.

[[Eravien Haund]] (LN male half-elf **noble**) imparts the following information to fellow Lords' Alliance members and tells them not to share it:
- The werewolf pack has almost a dozen members. The leader of the pack is a man named [[# Kiril Stoyanovich|Kiril]].
- The werewolves come from a distant land called [[Barovia]]. The Lords' Alliance has no information about it.
- The werewolves worship a deity called [[Mother Night]].
- The werewolves leave and return to Barovia through some kind of ancient portal. (This is a deduction on Eravien's part, based on the werewolf prisoner's vague description of how the pack gets to and from Barovia.)

Eravien believes that he can gain prestige within the Lords' Alliance if he learns the whereabouts of the "ancient portal" that the werewolves are using and destroys it. He is convinced that the portal represents a danger not only to Daggerford but also to Waterdeep. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Any Lords' Alliance character who agrees to destroy it is given a spell scroll of magic weapon.</mark> Eravien also promises to furnish the character with a letter of recommendation (see "Marks of Prestige" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) once the portal is destroyed.

**About the Lords' Alliance.** The Lords' Alliance is a coalition of political powers concerned with their mutual security and prosperity. Heading the coalition are rulers in the North and along the Sword Coast.
Although alliance members have pledged to join forces against common threats, every lord in it places the fate and fortune of his or her settlement above all others. Agents of the alliance are chosen primarily for their loyalty, and are trained in observation, stealth, innuendo, and combat. Backed by the wealthy, they carry well-made equipment (often disguised to appear common). Alliance operatives are often glory hounds.

## Zhentarim

	The Black Network sees the werewolf menace as an opportunity to provide lords and nervous landowners with mercenaries to protect their holdings. But at least one of your fellow members has a grudge against the lycanthropes. Davra Jassur, a member of the Zhentarim based in Waterdeep, arranges a private meeting with you.

[[Davra Jassur]] (LE female human **assassin**) poses as a recruiter for the Black Network but is, in fact, a cutthroat who quietly disposes of competitors. Her husband, Yarak, was also a member of the Black Network. He was escorting a caravan traveling from Daggerford to the Way Inn (about sixty miles southeast of Daggerford, along the Trade Way) when the werewolves attacked. Yarak was slain, and Davra wants revenge; she wants the head of the werewolf pack leader. She is too tied up with "business" to engage in a personal vendetta, but if another member of the Black Network were to help, she would owe that individual a special favor (see "Marks of Prestige" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

**About the Zhentarim.** The Zhentarim is an unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its influence throughout the Forgotten Realms. The public face of the Black Network appears relatively benign. It offers the best and cheapest goods and services, both legal and illicit, hoping to undercut its competitors.

Members of the Zhentarim think of themselves as members of an extended family and rely on it for resources and security. At the same time, members are granted the autonomy to increase their own wealth and influence. As a whole, the Zhentarim promises "the best for the best," although in truth the organization is more interested in spreading its own propaganda and influence than investing in the improvement of its members.

## Welcome to Barovia
[[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is using the werewolves to lure adventurers to his domain. Characters can follow the werewolves' tracks into the Misty Forest. After hours of fruitless searching, the characters are engulfed by thick fog:

	The woods darken as the trees begin to close ranks, their needle-covered arms interlocking to blot out the sun. The shroud of mist that covers the ground turns into creeping walls of gray fog that silently envelop you until you can't see more than a few feet in any direction. Soon, even the werewolf tracks disappear.
No matter which direction they go, the characters come to a lonely dirt road that cuts through the woods, leading to area A (see chapter 2). <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">As an alternative, you can have them enter Barovia near [[Krezk]] (see chapter 8).</mark>
