The events of this adventure are part of dark twists of fate that a fortuneteller can discern with the cards of a tarokka deck. Before you run this adventure, you must draw cards from a deck to determine the following elements of the adventure:
- Strahd's location inside Castle Ravenloft
- The placement of three important treasures that can be used against Strahd-the *[[Tome of Strahd]]*, the *[[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]]*, and the *[[Sunsword]]*
- The identity of a powerful ally in the fight against Strahd
This card reading can make the adventure different each time you play it.

At some point during the adventure, the characters are likely to meet Madam Eva, the old Vistani seer (see chapter 2, area G), who can perform the same card reading for them. Characters can also have Ezmerelda d'Avenir perform a card reading for them, provided she has her deck of tarokka cards. Ezmerelda's cards are hidden in her wagon (chapter 11, area Vl).

Appendix E shows all the cards of the tarokka deck and summarizes their symbolic meanings.
